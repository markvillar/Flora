# Flora

## Status: Under development

Flora is an iOS app that provides information about the place relative to the user's current location.

### About

I used the UIKit framework to build the interface both programmatically and through the use of Storyboards or interface builder in Xcode. I used another two iOS frameworks in this project which are CoreLocation & MapKit to both retrieve and present locations in a map. I also have experience in using third-party libraries and backends such as Google’s Firestore and RxSwift for reactive programming.

1. The app takes advantage of **Wikipedia** articles using [**WikipediaKit**](https://github.com/Raureif/WikipediaKit) framework.
2. ~~The app uses Firebase as backend to store highlighted places~~
3. ~~Google Places API to reverse~~

### To Do:
1. ~~Dynamic fetching of articles~~
2. ~~Optimise fetching of articles~~
3. Format/Style the **HTML** returned by **Wikipedia**
